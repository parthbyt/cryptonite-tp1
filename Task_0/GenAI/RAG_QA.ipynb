        "**Q.1** How often does the agent hallucinate facts not present in retrieved text?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** As clear from type 5 questions, if the data is absurd like 'What did Isaac Newton tweet?', It'll not hallucinate, but if the data closer to real life 'like World War III' which might had some arbiratory reference in text, the model has higher chance of hallucinating.\n",
        "Also as shown by type 4 questions, being asked for explicit answers (like population of mars or name of president in 2023) the model has much higher chance of not guessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.2** How sensitive is answer quality to retrieval errors?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** It is quite specific fro small models like flan-t5-small, where it tended to treat wrong retrievels as only truth (like if there was any city name it would classify it as capital of paris without knowing whether it really was capital related or just a random drop.). However when we switch to larger models like flan-t5-base, we observed that it better understood the grammatical structure of test and could differentiate between values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.3** How does reliability change across 25M, 80M, and 250M parameter models?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** It changes significantly. Although I could not find an appropriate 25M model with a context window enough to run the model, I tried with faln-t5-small with 80M parameter. The major change across reliability was relying on context size change since 512 token model was not able to get enough retrieved text to generate accurately and chose to stay silent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.4** Which matters more: strict prompting or rule-based post-editing?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Based on my observations, strict prompting is much more important than post editing. In this case providing model with a prompt to refuse was much more helpful than trying to implement it via rule based editing. As the model sizes imporved, I could achieve better grammar and reduced depenendence on post based editing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.5** How accurately does the agent refuse when information is missing?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** As shown by types 5 and 4, the agent will refuse if it does not have concrete facts but if something vaguely related or has mentions like 'World War 3' it will try to guess/hallucinate."
